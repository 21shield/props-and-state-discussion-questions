# Props and State Discussion Questions

1. What is the difference between props vs. state in React? When would you use state instead of props?
2. Assuming `UserDetail` is a functional component, what will it's `props` look like if it's rendered as below?

```javascript
const user = {name: 'Spider Man', age: 32}
< UserDetail title="Profile Page" dog="Fido"  user={ user } />
```

3. Take a look at Slack. Pretend you were going to recreate this. What components would you have? What different pieces of state would you need to keep track of? What components would need to receive those as props?
